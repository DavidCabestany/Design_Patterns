# Design_Patterns

Learning_skills of patterns

Those are the scripts for Python from the course Dive to Design of Patterns.

Contains the descriptions of 22 classic design patterns
formulated by the “Gang of Four” (or simply GoF) in 1994.
Each chapter explores a particular pattern. Therefore, you can
read from cover to cover or by picking the patterns you’re interested
in.


Many patterns are related, so you can easily jump from topic
to topic using numerous anchors. The end of each chapter has
a list of links between the current pattern and others. If you
see the name of a pattern that you haven’t seen yet, just keep
reading—this item will appear in one of the next chapters.
Design patterns are universal. Therefore, all code samples in
this book are written in pseudocode that doesn’t constrain the
material to a particular programming language.
Prior to studying patterns, you can refresh your memory by
going over the key terms of object-oriented programming.
That chapter also explains the basics of UML diagrams, which
is useful because the book has tons of them. Of course, if you
already know all of that, you can proceed to learning patterns
right away.
